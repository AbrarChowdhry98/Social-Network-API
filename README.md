# Social-Network-API

The foundation of these social networking platforms is data, it’s important that developers understand how to build and structure the API first. This API is built for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
